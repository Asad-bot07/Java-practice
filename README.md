# ☕ Java Practice Programs

Welcome to my **Java Practice Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of random Java programs I've written while learning and experimenting with different concepts in Java. It's not organized by topic,just a place for hands-on practice and exploration.

## 📁 What You'll Find

- Simple code snippets
- Programs based on control structures (if-else, loops, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples
- Concept tests and rough implementations

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not meant to be a polished or structured tutorial.  
It's a **sandbox** for me to:

- Practice new Java topics
- Experiment with logic
- Learn by doing

You may find a mix of beginner and intermediate-level code here.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure you have Java installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   java -version

## Compile a file with:

```
javac Filename.java
```

## Run the compiled class with:

```
java FileName
```

> ⚠️ Some files might contain a main method inside different classes. Make sure you're running the correct one.

## 🤖 Contributions

This is just my personal learning space, so contributions aren't expected.
But feel free to fork, clone, or use the code as a reference for your own learning!

## 📌 Note

- Code quality may vary.
- Some files may be incomplete or experimental.
- No fixed folder structure — it's all based on practice flow.
